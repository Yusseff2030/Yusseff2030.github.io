	                    I know that the PS5 was released Nov 12 but I never had the chance to speak about it. I think that it has a really cool and futurestic realease. However, the size is a huge factor, and in my opinion the PS5 is a bit too big. If a person doesn't have that much space below his tv it will become a struggle to figure out where to place it. I know you can place it sideways but it will still take horizontal space. Otherwise this is a beautiful piece of technology!

	                <h3>iPhone 12</h3>
	                <small>Posted 5 Jan 2021, By Youssof</small>

	                	The iPhone 12 has been released, lets talk about it. It has a new boxy design that they brought back from the old iPhone SE which I presonally like. It can now support 5G which is nice, but a major new feature is that it can now record 4K HDR, and has a new 5nm processing chip (A14 Bionic). It came out in 4 different colors. But with such features comes a great price tag, the cheapest being the iPhone mini for $999! thats the cheapest!
