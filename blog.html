						I am so excited, today I'm writing my very first blog post on this website, I know the website doesn't look the
						best. But I'm currently learning CSS to improve how it looks. We all thought 2021 would be magically better. But I
						don't think thats how it will go. All I could do is hope for best. There isn't anything too special for me to talk
						about. So I will end this blog post here. Bye!

					<h3>Android vs iOS</h3>
					<small>Posted 9 Jan 2021, By Youssof</small>
					<p>
						Look, I love iOS I use it as my main OS everyday, but I also like to use andriod because of the features it has that
						iOS doesn't. Features include widgets, google store, etc. I use both of them to be more open minded towords different 
						OS's, it increases my knowledge on how to use both of them. Don't get me wrong I love apple, in fact, i'm using a mac
						right now to write this. But I also like other andriod companies. That's all I have to say. Bye!
