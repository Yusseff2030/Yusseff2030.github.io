                <p>
                    I am so excited, today I'm writing my very first blog post on this website, I know the website doesn't look the best. But I'm currently learning CSS to improve how it looks. We all though 2021 would be magically better. But I don't think thats how it will go. All I could do is hope for best. There isn't anything too special for me to talk about. So I will end this blog post here. Bye!
